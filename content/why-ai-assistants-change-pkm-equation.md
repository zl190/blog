# Why AI Assistants Change the PKM Equation

## Hook

The biggest problem in Personal Knowledge Management isn't capture—it's processing. We all collect notes, but who actually reviews them?

## Thesis

AI assistants like Claude Code solve the "processing problem" that habits alone cannot fix.

---

## Section 1: The Processing Problem

Traditional PKM workflow:
```
Capture → Manual Review → Extract to Permanent Notes
              ↑
        (This rarely happens)
```

The dirty secret: most people capture but never process. Notes accumulate. Fleeting notes stay fleeting forever.

## Section 2: How AI Changes the Equation

With an AI assistant:
```
Capture → AI Processes → Routes Automatically
```

| Traditional PKM | AI-Augmented PKM |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Capture → manual review → extract | Capture → AI processes → routes |
| Daily note = inbox needing triage | `/capture` = immediate routing |
| Weekly review = you do the work | `/reflect` = AI does heavy lifting |

The human bottleneck is removed.

## Section 3: Capture Surfaces Reimagined

Multiple entry points, unified processing:

```
[Stickies]     ──→ /collect-stickies ──→ routes to destinations
[/capture]     ──→ immediate routing
[Daily Note]   ──→ /reflect ──→ extracts cards/todos
[Voice memo]   ──→ transcribe → /capture
```

All roads lead to the same organized system.

## Section 4: When to Still Use Daily Notes

Decision framework:

| Use Daily Notes If... | Skip If... |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Want unstructured thinking space | AI handles processing |
| Daily journaling ritual | Multiple entry points exist |
| Need calendar navigation | Occasional dumping only |

## Section 5: The New Best Practice

1. **Capture without friction** — use whatever surface is convenient
2. **Let AI process** — route to destinations (todos, events, cards)
3. **Review outputs, not inputs** — check organized cards, not raw notes

The insight: good habits are hard. Good systems with AI are easy.
